    <h3 id="about" class="blue">About me</h3>
    <p> Hello, My name is Aaron Bantay, and I would first like to thank you for taking the time to view
        my website. I was born and raised in San Diego, California, but I am currently a student at the <span class="maroon bold-element">University of California, Riverside</span>, studying computer science.</p>
    <p> Aside from coding, I enjoy shooting <span class="maroon bold-element">film photography</span>. Although I have a couple of rolls shot under my belt,
        I am still looking to improve my craft. I also enjoy making <span class="maroon bold-element">rugs/tufting</span>. It's been an interest of mine for a while,
        and I've finally gotten the chance to do so! My favorite sports team is the <span class="maroon bold-element">San Diego Padres</span>, but I also follow <span class="maroon bold-element">AC Milan</span> in Serie A. As far
        as music goes, I listen almost any chance I can get (I am probably listening as I am writing this!). I primarily enjoy <span class="maroon bold-element">Hip Hop, Indie Pop, Jazz and 
        R&B</span>. My favorite artists are <span class="maroon bold-element">Frank Sinatra, Bill Evans, Travis Scott, and Wave to Earth</span>. As a way to wind down, I read books! I am currently reading
        <span class="maroon bold-element">"The Way of Kings"</span> by Brandon Sanderson.
    </p>
    <p> I hope to be able to use my skills in web development to create websites for my hobbies. A website showcasing my film photos is one on my todo list! Please keep an eye out for that!</p>

    <!-- Maybe add some photos here showing a few film photos and some rugs?? -->
